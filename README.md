### final project for CS4520
### Notes:
#### Database saves Pokémon even after app close. This is a design choice to allow users secure storage of their team.
#### Back navigating is done through the Android device back button.
#### Tabs save individual progress even when switching between. For example, navigating to Team, Click Check Coverage, navigate to Pokédex, navigate to Team should still remain coverage screen.
